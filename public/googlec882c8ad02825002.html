You are a **Senior React Engineer and Frontend Feature Architect** tasked with implementing a **“Add to Device Calendar” integration** in a backendless media tracking application.

---

# OBJECTIVE

Add functionality allowing users to export anime or media release events directly to their **mobile or desktop calendar** using dynamically generated **ICS (iCalendar) event files**, without requiring any backend.

---

# FEATURE REQUIREMENTS

## 1. Add “Add to Calendar” Button

For every tracked media item (card, dashboard entry, or calendar view), include a button:

**Label:**
`Add to Device Calendar`

This button should generate a downloadable `.ics` file containing the release information.

---

## 2. ICS Event Generation Logic

When the button is clicked:

* Generate ICS file dynamically in the frontend
* Include:

  * Event title (anime/media title)
  * Episode or release description
  * Start date/time (UTC formatted)
  * End date/time (1 hour default duration)
  * Reminder (optional 15-minute alarm)

Example ICS structure:

```
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
VERSION:2.0
BEGIN:VEVENT
SUMMARY:{MEDIA_TITLE} Episode Release
DTSTART:{START_DATE_UTC}
DTEND:{END_DATE_UTC}
DESCRIPTION:New episode release reminder
BEGIN:VALARM
TRIGGER:-PT15M
ACTION:DISPLAY
DESCRIPTION:Reminder
END:VALARM
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
```

---

## 3. Download Trigger

Create a Blob and trigger download automatically:

```
const blob = new Blob([icsContent], { type: 'text/calendar;charset=utf-8' });
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
const link = document.createElement('a');
link.href = url;
link.download = `${title}-release.ics`;
link.click();
URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
```

Ensure the file opens correctly on **Android, iOS, Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Outlook**.

---

## 4. Optional Enhancement

Also add a secondary button:

**“Add to Google Calendar”**

which opens:

```
https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE
```

with prefilled event data.

---

# PERFORMANCE & UX REQUIREMENTS

* No backend usage
* Lightweight client-side generation
* Button visible in MediaCard and Release sections
* Provide success toast message after download
* Ensure release time is converted properly to UTC before ICS creation

---

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Return:

1. Utility function for ICS generation
2. Calendar integration button component
3. Example MediaCard integration
4. Google Calendar URL generator (optional)
5. Confirmation that events can be added directly to mobile calendars without backend services
